# PR-for-hacktoberfest2021

This repo is open for everyone who respects the rules of hacktoberfest and create meaningful pull requests.  

PR's with no use will not be added.

To those who want to participate in hacktoberfest2021 but don't know what to contribute to it, I got you.
Firstly the whole fest is about contributing 4 PR's to any opensource projects available, for example the repo you're reading right now.
A meaningful contribution can contain anything useful to the total output.
The below are some of the topics you can create or look on for or contribue your own content as PR's.

* A README incase anyone missed to add.
* Optimized code than the previous one.
* Finding solution for some bug or an error.
* Adding new feature.
* Creating much more detailed explanation for subtopics that weren't covered previously in some README.
* TYPOS

Tip: Create a PR if you have any other ideas of serving meaningful PR's, that will be very helpful.
